# 🧏 Accessible User Interface Design and Testing for People with Hearing Loss

This project presents an innovative interface aimed at enhancing accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments using sign language recognition and intuitive interaction through gesture inputs.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To create a user-friendly application that detects American Sign Language (ASL) gestures and translates them into meaningful digital interactions. This is especially helpful for individuals who rely on sign language as their primary mode of communication.

## 🧪 Features & Functionalities

- 🤟 **ASL Gesture Recognition** using image data
- 📸 Image-based gesture input with hand tracking
- 🧠 Python-based classifier logic
- 🖥️ Easy-to-use interface design (testing ready)
- 🧪 Prototyping and testing with multiple gesture inputs
- 💬 Focused on inclusivity and accessibility for users with hearing disabilities
